# Minecraft Launcher -- Electron/Node.js

A Minecraft Launcher made with electron/node.js.

## Progress

This project is in WIP status. Here is the current roadmap for the project:
- [x] Parallel download handler for faster download speeds as minecraft assets are tiny and a lot in amount.
- [ ] Structuring the [game files](https://wiki.vg/Game_files).
    - [ ] Better parsing for `rules`.
    - [ ] Creating list of files.
    - [ ] Extracting `natives`.
    - [ ] Preparing command line arguments to run the game.
- [ ] Publish the code as soon as the game can run.
- [ ] File check system.
- [ ] Logging system with `log4js`.
- [ ] Making a ui to launch the game using `spectre.css`.
- [ ] Implementing auth system.
